##### Game Download Cache Docker Container

#### Introduction

This docker container provides a caching proxy server for game download content. This will drastically reduce internet bandwidth consumption for any network with multiple gaming PCs connected.

The primary use case is gaming events, such as LAN parties, which need to be able to cope with hundreds or thousands of computers receiving an unannounced patch - without spending a fortune on internet connectivity. Other uses include smaller networks, such as Internet Cafes and home networks, where the new games are regularly installed on multiple computers; or multiple independent operating systems on the same computer.

This container is designed to support any game that uses HTTP and also supports HTTP range requests (used by Origin). This should make it suitable for:

 - Steam (Valve)
 - Origin (EA Games)
 - Riot Games (League of Legends)
 - Battle.net (Hearthstone, Starcraft 2, Overwatch)
 - Frontier Launchpad (Elite Dangerous, Planet Coaster)
 - Uplay (Ubisoft)
 - Windows Updates

## Usage

You will need to have a DNS server forwarding queries to the machine your docker container is running on. You can use the [steamcache-dns](https://hub.docker.com/r/steamcache/steamcache-dns/) docker image to do this or you can use a DNS service already on your network see the [steamcache-dns github page](https://github.com/steamcache/steamcache-dns) for more information.

Run the origin container using the following to allow TCP port 80 (HTTP) through the host machine. Replace `/tmp/data` with a directory to store downloaded data, such as a dedicated hard-drive.

```
docker run -it --name steamcache-generic -p 80:80 -v /tmp/data:/data steamcache/generic:latest
```

#### Additional options

* `-d` will run the docker container in the background. Access the logs with `docker logs steamcache-generic`.
* `--network host` will use the host networking stack for improved performance.
* `--log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3` will automatically rotate container logs.
* `-it` will attach an interactive tty for debugging but is not needed in production and can be removed.

## Quick Explanation

For a steam cache to function on your network you need two services.
* A depot cache service [This container](https://github.com/steamcache/generic)
* A special DNS service [steamcache-dns](https://github.com/steamcache/steamcache-dns)

The cache service transparently proxies your requests for content to the content procider, or serves the content to you if it already has it.

## Running on Startup

Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation to run the container at startup.
